There is a great fountain in the center of this courtyard.
The waters are bright and clear in the magickal light
emanating from your eyes.

There were once plants growing here, but they are all 
dead and gnarled now.

If you stand still here, you can hear the soft rippling
of water, and even the occasional splash.

Perhaps there are fish that yet live in the fountain?
